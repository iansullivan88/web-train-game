#Train Game
A simple web based game written in typescript. The game is built using [Phaser](https://phaser.io).

It's not really a game as there is no objective or even any fun involved. A demo can be found [here](https://iansullivan88.github.io/web-train-game/). Click and drag to create tracks and press 'go' put a train on the track.
